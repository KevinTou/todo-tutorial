## Functional Requirements

Before coding, I'd like to take the time to figure out what kind of requirements that's expected from a todo list.

- Define what a todo is
- Have an input box where a user can enter a todo
- Have a button which a user can click to submit a todo
- Have a checkbox to toggle a completed state for each todo
- Have a delete button to get rid of completed todos
- Have the todo populate in a list after submitting
- Persist todo list
